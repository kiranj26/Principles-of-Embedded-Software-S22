# PES Assignment4 : Traffic Lights:
Student name : Kiran Jojare

# Description: 
For this assignment we will are creating a traffic light simulation using LED's connected on KL25Z.
The code apprroach is via state machine usng CASE statement. The states are as follows:

We have been hired to develop a new traffic light for export to the little-known mountain town of Boulder. 
Their traffic lights have the following behavior:
* When the traffic light is in the STOP state, Boulder residents use the color #FF00001.
* When the traffic light is in the GO state, Boulder residents use the color #00FF00
* When the traffic light is in the WARNING state, Boulder residents use the color #FFFF00
* When someone presses the button to cross the street (CROSSWALK state), the traffic light is 
blinking with the color #001030. In the CROSSWALK state, the light blinks 250 msec off, 750 msec on. In all other states, the light is solid (not blinking).

Except for the blinking in CROSSWALK mode, all other changes in traffic light color must transition gradually and linearly over a one-second period. 

Timing Calculations for Both Debug and Production for each state is as follows:
| **State**    | **Debug Time** | **Production Time** |
| :------: | :-------: | :-------------: |
|  STOP    |  5 sec    |      20 sec     |
|          |           |                 |
|  GO      |  5 sec    |      20 sec     |
|          |           |                 |
| WARNING  |  3 sec    |       5 sec     |
|          |           |                 |
| CROSSWALK  |  5 sec    |       5 sec     |
|          |           |                 |
| TRANSITION  |  1 sec    |       1 sec     |
|          |           |                 |

The software also take care of functionality when a slider or switch is detected when its already in transition state. On such occation, transition time will be incremeneted by 1 sec from current and the color change is still found to be gradual by software.  

Note the slider is not driven by interrupt. Its polling at every 125 ms time. However switch is driven by interrupt. For the swicth section please see please see the [EXTRA CREDIT](#extra-credit) section below.

# Code Organisation
The project code is organized as follows:
| File Name         | Description                                                                                               |
| -----------------| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `main.c`          | Main file which is an entry point function for the code. This function does all the initialisation and calls the state machine. |
| `TSI_Sensor.c`    | This file defines a set of functions for controlling LEDs on the MKL25Z4 microcontroller. It contains pin definitions for the red, green, and blue LEDs, as well as functions for initializing the LEDs, turning them on and off, and toggling them in specific patterns. The file also includes a `delay_ms()` function that provides a delay in milliseconds, using the microcontroller's system clock. |
| `TSI_Sensor.h`    | Header file for `TSI_Sensor.c`. It includes necessary libraries and defines macros for TSI sensing operation. Macros are defined for touch offset, touch count, and TSI data. Macros are also defined for slider touch detection, with left and right slider touched values, and slider not touched value. |
| `Timing.c`        | This file contains the implementation of timer functions used for tracking time in the system. Functions such as `sytick_init()`, `systic_handler()`, etc. are available here. |
| `Timing.h`        | Header file for all the timing calculation including function declaration, typedefs, and global data. |
| `Switch_Interrupt.c` | This file contains all the switch functionality including switch interrupt initialisation and interrupt handler. |
| `Switch_Interrupt.h` | Header file for switch interrupt functionality. |
| `StateMachine.c`  | The file contains the main logic for state function. It implements all the state functions and state transitions as described in the state diagram. |
| `StateMachine.h`  | Header file for the state machine function including all the necessary function declarations and global and local data. |
| `PWM_LED_Func.c`  | This file defines all the PWM based and LED based functionality. |
| `PWM_LED_Func.h`  | Header file for all the PWM based and LED based functionality. |
| `log.h`           | This file is for logging the output on UART console.                                                       |

# Calibration Data

Following touch sensor calibrations are added in file `TSI_Sensor.c`. feel free to change it accordingly if required. 

```
#define TOUCH_OFFSET 		(600)  					// offset value to be subtracted
#define TOUCH_DATA 			(TSI0->DATA & 0xFFFF)	//macro for extracting the count from data register

// Macros for touch sense detection
#define TOUCH_DETECT_THD   	(300) 					// The threshold value for touch detection.
                                					// If the touch sensor value is greater than or equal to this value,
                                					// touch is considered to be detected.
#define TOUCH_DETECTED     	(1)  					// The return value when touch is detected by the TSI_touch_detected() function.
#define TOUCH_NOT_DETECTED 	(0)   					// The return value when touch is not detected by the T
```

## Review Date:
March 9 2023

## Review Comments:

1. Some function descriptions are missing
    - Added missing function description
2. Log messages on UART does not follow requirements:
    - Correct the UART prints by adding more trasitions to the code. Aslo added /r/n wherever required:
3. Use greater than equal instead of greater than to avoid extra Tick:
    - Corrected the if conditions in state machine to avoid one extra tick by replacing < with <=:
4. Define enum in .c instead of .h:
    - Corrected. Added enum defination which is local to the file to the .c file and not .h:
5. Use of extern could be modified:
    - Could not work on it due to limited time.
6. Remove unnecessary header files like stdio.h, stdint.h :
    - Done. Removed one stdio.h and stdlib.h from the main.c file
7. While (1) in state machine to be removed and should be called in main's while(1)
    - Done, Removed while(1) from state_function().
8. Missing reset_timer() from GO to CROSSWALK transition
    - Done, corrected the logic accordingly.

# Extent Bugs

The code works fine as per requirements. Please not the extra credit part of the code is not tested actually with a button. It has been tested by connecting a jumper from PTA4 pin to a GND when interrupt is requested. The jumper if floating if the interrupt is not requested.
