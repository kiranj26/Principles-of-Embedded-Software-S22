# Principles-of-Embedded-Software-S22

This repository contains a collection of assignments completed for the subject "Principles of Embedded Software." The course focuses on developing a strong understanding of the C programming language and its application in professional embedded software development. Throughout the course, I have gained the following skills and knowledge:

## Skills and Knowledge

1. **Foundational C Programming:** I have developed a solid understanding of the C programming language, including its syntax, data types, control structures, and functions. I have applied this knowledge to write efficient and robust software for resource-limited embedded systems.

2. **Software-Hardware Interaction:** I have learned how software interacts with hardware in embedded systems. This includes understanding the implications of the C programming language on the underlying architecture and utilizing hardware interfaces for efficient communication.

3. **Development Environment:** I have worked with various tools and technologies commonly used in embedded software development. These include version control systems, configuration management, development kits, cross-compiling, and cross-debugging. I have gained practical experience in setting up and configuring the development environment.

4. **Memory Management:** I have explored memory constraints and efficient memory management techniques in resource-limited embedded systems. This includes understanding memory types, allocation strategies, and optimizing memory usage for performance and power consumption.

5. **Peripheral and Device Drivers:** I have acquired knowledge of interfacing with peripherals and selecting suitable processors for specific embedded applications. I have learned to develop device drivers to enable communication between software and hardware components.

6. **Scheduling and Optimization:** I have studied scheduling algorithms for embedded systems, ensuring real-time performance and meeting resource constraints. I have also gained insights into optimizing software for improved performance and reduced power consumption.

7. **Testing and Debugging:** I have developed and refined practices for testing and debugging embedded software. I have learned various techniques to identify and resolve software issues, ensuring the reliability and robustness of the code.
