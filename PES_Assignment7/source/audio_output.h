 * @file    audio_output.h
 * @brief   C file  that contains functions to initialize the DAC module on the KL25Z board and generate
 * sine wave tones of different frequencies. It also contains a function to output these tones through
 * the DAC using DMA transfers. The module generates two tones, A4 (440Hz) and D5 (587Hz), using the DAC
 * module on the KL25Z board
