 * @brief   Main file for PES Assignment 6
 *          This assignment works on providing UARt based serial command intepreter
 *          running over UART0. Serial intepretor is implemented to help QA team to
 *          fully excersise new board. A linkedlist queue has been developed and
 *          tested throughly. UART0 has been configured for Trasmittion and
 *          Reception over UART.
